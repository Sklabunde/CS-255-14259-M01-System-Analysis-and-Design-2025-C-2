Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  For this class, we worked with a DriverPass client.  This client was looking to design a website where a future driver could take online classes and exams and schedule road lessons.

What did you do particularly well?
  I felt I was good at putting together the functional requirements and I enjoyed making the diagrams that were needed.  I feel like I have a good attention to detail when it comes to listening to a stakeholder’s needs.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  One thing that I would revise would be the non-functional requirements.  I feel that I could add more and be more specific in them.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I felt that I was very good at taking the user’s needs and putting them into the requirements document and then pulling from that to enter into the diagrams.  From there it should be easier to write it into the code.  It is extremely important to consider the user’s needs as otherwise they could end up with a system that is not doing what they need it to.  Conversely, you do not want to create a system that has a lot of extras as there is a cost for those extras.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  In designing software, I want to be organized.  I like to make sure that I am testing frequently.  I want to accept any feedback given.  I like the way we learned to put the stakeholders needs into a business requirements document and from there make diagrams as needed.  I feel that would make writing the code easier and more concise.
